This privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you about how ShipBoss collects, uses and stores your personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information in operating the Website.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">How does the Website Work?</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            The Website enables anonymous visitors to the Website ("Visitors") to browse the Website, and Visitors who are register with us ("Registrants") to use our shipping functionality. The terms "you", "your" and "yours" when used herein refer to either Registrants or Visitors, or to both Registrants and Visitors collectively, as applicable; provided that such terms will refer collectively to both Registrants and Visitors unless the context of this Agreement indicates otherwise. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions which governs your use of the Website.  Your use of the Website is subject to ShipBoss's Terms of Use agreement, which can be found at: shipboss.io/terms-of-use.<br><br>
                            You can make general use of the Website without providing any PII to ShipBoss. However, you will need to provide us or third parties with certain of your PII in order to use certain of the Website's functionality, such as purchasing any of the products and/or services appearing on the Website or otherwise becoming a Registrant.<br><br>
                            By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your PII and other information by ShipBoss as described in this Privacy Policy.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">How can the terms of this Privacy Policy be modified?</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            We reserve the right to change how we handle and use the information that we collect through the Website, and to modify this Privacy Policy, at any time in our sole discretion. You agree to review this Privacy Policy periodically to be aware of all such modifications. You further agree that your continued use of the Website after a modified version of this Privacy Policy has been posted shall be deemed to be your conclusive acceptance of any modified version of this Privacy Policy. We will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by updating the date indicated after "Last Updated" at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the initial version and each modified version of this Privacy Policy, as applicable, then you are not authorized to use the Website. A current version of this Privacy Policy is accessible via the footer of the Website's homepage.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">What type of PII does ShipBoss collect from you and how do we use it?</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            You need to provide us with certain PII in order to use certain interactive functionality of the Website, such as making purchases or sending us certain reviews. The information we will request may include without limitation your name, address, phone number and email address.<br><br>
                            ShipBoss may provide your PII to individuals or entities who work on our behalf or with us. These individuals or entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests and to help us communicate with you about different products, services or resources appearing on the Website.  For example, we may transfer information collected at registration, including your PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in processing your order or otherwise fulfilling requests made by you.  We also may transfer or permit the transfer of certain of your PII or other information to service providers and other third parties who assist us in operating the Website.  ShipBoss may also use and disclose PII to improve and enhance your experience on the Website and for other purposes.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Under what other circumstances may we release PII?</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            In addition to sharing your PII with third parties as described above, we may also release your PII to other third parties if we believe that such release is necessary (a) to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization or requirement) or a court order, (b) in order to apply or enforce the Terms of Use, (c) to protect you, other Website users, or us from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or (d) if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person or property requires the disclosure of such PII or otherwise if we believe such a disclosure is needed to protect our interests (as determined by us in our sole discretion).<br><br>
                            Our rights under this Privacy Policy may be automatically assigned by ShipBoss, in our sole discretion, to a third party or parties, and such an assignment will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and/or licensees. Without limitation of the foregoing, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including without limitation your PII, with any company under our common control, joint venture, as well as to a potential acquirer and/or an acquirer (including without limitation in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets or stock, or in the event of bankruptcy). In each such instance, the PII we have collected from you may be one of the assets transferred in connection with such a transaction.

Action tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional and other business purposes.
