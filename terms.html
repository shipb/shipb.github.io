                            discretion) either notify you of any necessary price adjustments prior to final processing and

                            such third party) to charge your credit card for the associated purchase requested by you. By making
                            a purchase through the Website, you agree to pay us (or our service provider, as the case may be)
                            all charges at the prices then in effect using the payment method selected by you. Your right to

                            costs (such as taxes and delivery) for each order you execute through the Website. If all such
                            payment and costs cannot be charged to your credit card or if a charge is refunded for any reason,
                            including by chargeback, we reserve the right to refuse to either fulfill your order and bill you
                            for its cost or to cancel your order, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Again, you are
                            fully responsible for the cost of all orders made under your Account or otherwise in your name, and
                            you will pay us all fees associated with any reversal of any purchase by you. Your credit card
                            payment may be rejected if we (or a third party working on our behalf) detect the presence of
                            certain fraud indicators or otherwise a pattern of misuse. Please note that whether a credit card is
                            accepted or rejected is not always determined by information provided by the cardholder, and we
                            apologize for any inconvenience for orders where a credit card payment is not acceptable.

                            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
                            of the State of New York, excluding New York's choice-of-law principles. Any dispute arising out of
                            or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation regarding any breach hereunder, shall be
                            finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under
                            its Commercial Arbitration Rules ("CAB"), and judgment upon the award rendered by the
                            arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted in New
                            York, NY by an arbitrator with applicable industry expertise in ecommerce businesses, who shall be
                            named in accordance with such rules. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you
                            and us, without a right of appeal, and shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons upon which
                            the award is based, and such statement as well as all information concerning such arbitration
                            proceedings including without limitation all evidence and materials submitted by you and/or us shall
                            be deemed to be confidential information and shall not be made public by you or any person on your
                            behalf or for your interest (and any submission made to any court as part of such a proceeding shall
                            be made under seal if permissible). However, if the AAA refuses to hear the arbitration under the
                            CAB, the parties agree to have the arbitration conducted by a private professional arbitrator
                            reasonably agreed upon by the parties according to rules and procedures which closely resemble the
                            CAB (as determined by such arbitrator). If either party sues the other party and loses the claim
                            which was the subject of such a suit, then the non-prevailing party shall pay the prevailing party's
                            costs and expenses, including but not limited to the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees.
                            NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, AND
                            NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may apply to

                            provision, without breach of this arbitration provision. YOU AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR
                            LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST ANY OF THE SHIPBOSS PARTIES WHICH ARISES
                            OUT OF OR IS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR PURCHASE OF ANY OF
